abstract = {JSON -- the most popular data format for sending API requests and responses -- is still lacking a standardized schema or meta-data definition that allows the developers to specify the structure of JSON documents. JSON Schema is an attempt to provide a general purpose schema language for JSON, but it is still work in progress, and the formal specification has not yet been agreed upon. Why this could be a problem becomes evident when examining the behaviour of numerous tools for validating JSON documents against this initial schema proposal: although they agree on most general cases, when presented with the greyer areas of the specification they tend to differ significantly. In this paper we provide the first formal definition of syntax and semantics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementing this layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice. This is done both by analysing the theoretical aspects of the validation problem and by showing how to set up and validate a JSON Schema for Wikidata, the central storage for Wikimedia.},

abstract="TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript intended to enable easier development of large-scale JavaScript applications. While every JavaScript program is a TypeScript program, TypeScript offers a module system, classes, interfaces, and a rich gradual type system. The intention is that TypeScript provides a smooth transition for JavaScript programmers---well-established JavaScript programming idioms are supported without any major rewriting or annotations. One interesting consequence is that the TypeScript type system is not statically sound by design. The goal of this paper is to capture the essence of TypeScript by giving a precise definition of this type system on a core set of constructs of the language. Our main contribution, beyond the familiar advantages of a robust, mathematical formalization, is a refactoring into a safe inner fragment and an additional layer of unsafe rules.",

abstract = {Various implementation approaches for developing a domain-specific language are available in literature. There are certain common beliefs about the advantages/disadvantages of these approaches. However, it is hard to be objective and speak in favor of a particular one, since these implementation approaches are normally compared over diverse application domains. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical results from ten diverse implementation approaches for domain-specific languages, but conducted using the same representative language. Comparison shows that these discussed approaches differ in terms of the effort need to implement them, however, the effort needed by a programmer to implement a domain-specific language should not be the only factor taken into consideration. Another important factor is the effort needed by an end-user to rapidly write correct programs using the produced domain-specific language. Therefore, this paper also provides empirical results on end-user productivity, which is measured as the lines of code needed to express a domain-specific program, similarity to the original notation, and how error-reporting and debugging are supported in a given implementation.}

In this paper we present our solution for partial Web migration: it allows users to interactively select parts of existing interfaces and have them migrate to a target device. The underlying supporting platform exploits logical user interface descriptions and a set of transformations. This environment is particularly useful for supporting mobile users accessing complex Web applications, such as various emerging mash-ups. We also show an example of use of our solution in a widespread Web application, and report on a user test.},

Our implementation provides developers with low migration costs through built-in mechanisms for the synchronization of a UI state, requiring minimal changes to existing languages. Additionally, we describe a solution to categorize device characteristics and dynamically change UI allocation to best-fit devices. We illustrate the use of Panelrama through three sample applications which demonstrate its support for known interaction methods, we also present the results of a developer study, which validates our belief that cross-device application experiences can be easily implemented using our framework.},

Such environments are characterized by a wide set of interactive devices, with interactive applications that exploit a number of functionalities developed beforehand and encapsulated in Web services. In this article, we discuss how a novel model-based UIDL can provide useful support both at design and runtime for these types of applications. Web service annotations can also be exploited for providing hints for user interface development at design time. At runtime the language is exploited to support dynamic generation of user interfaces adapted to the different devices at hand during the user interface migration process, which is particularly important in ubiquitous environments.},
