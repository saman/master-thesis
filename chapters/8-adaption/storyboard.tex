Figure \ref{fig:storyboard} shows a storyboard of implemented run-time state migration approach on two same-purpose applications which are Mailspring and K-9 Mail.

Shows only K-9 Mail on an Android device is in the network. The user clicks on compose e-mail button on K-9 Mail to write an e-mail

\paragraph{Shot 2}
A compose form shows up on K-9 Mail and users writes the e-mail. She wants to switch to another device, so she runs Mailspring on a Mac device.
