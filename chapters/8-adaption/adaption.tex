\chapter{Adaption of example applications}
\label{ch:adaption}
In this chapter, to show the feasibility of the approach, as part of the thesis, two open-source e-mail clients adapted to support run-time state migration based on the developed approach. These applications are for different platforms, and their source code are freely accessible to allow the integration of libraries. 
Suggestions for e-mail clients to be adapted are K-9 Mail for Android and Mailspring for desktop operating systems. They are interactive applications for end-users and have sufficient complexity (e.g., applications does not have only one single state).
K9-Mail Android application is developed in Java; therefore, it requires the Android library. Moreover, Mailspring is developed using Electron and Node.js for desktop operating systems, and it needs the JavaScript library.

As a developer who wants to implement the enabling run-time state migration, we used the developed approach, middleware, libraries, and adapt these existing same-purpose applications. 

\section{Application State Models}
After analysing states of these applications and their source code (Table \ref{tab:states_of_email_applications}), we decided to model search and sending-email states. We developed two common Application State Models for these two applications. 
\subsection{Search}
\subsection{Sending E-mail}
