it's a subset of json schema.

it uses json schmea semantic.

it allows developers to write a custom model.

it models a state individually.

so application can have multiple states.

it's not modeling the transition.

pros:
different states which allows different domain application can share a specific part of them. like an email domain application has a calendar which can migrate data with calendar application of a phone.

the language doesn't introduce a new syntax, because is based on JSON Schema.
