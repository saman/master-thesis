The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the fundamentals of Model-driven Software Engineering, Domain-specific language, and an explanation of their terminologies. In Chapter 3, state of the art in run-time state migration as related work is presented. Chapter 4 addresses the requirements and analysis towards the modeling approach and a brief solution overview. In Chapter 5, we explain the Domain-specific language for our approach. Chapter 6 explains ideas of our approach as an architecture overview. In Chapter 7, the detail of the implementation part of the thesis is explained. Chapter 8 discusses the adaption of the run-time migration approach as a real-world example. The thesis is concluded in Chapter 9 with a description of the approach, its limitations, and the work that can be done in the future.
