\chapter{Language for Run-time State Migration}
\label{ch:language}
Based on the requirements (Chapter \ref{ch:requirements}) we came up with the idea of making a DSL to migrate the run-time states.
In this chapter, the DSL definition, specification and its terminologies are described. This includes a desperation of the meta-model, the concrete and abstract syntax, the interpretation of the DSL, and some example mapping.
