\chapter{Language for Run-time State Migration}
\label{ch:language}
As stated by \textbf{R2 Platform-independent State Specification}, need a platform-independent representation of run-time state. For this, we develop a language to describe run-time states. The requirements for this language are on the requirements D1 to D3 (Chapter \ref{ch:requirements}).
In this chapter, the DSL definition and interpretation, specification of run-time state, and terminology used are described.
% This includes the interpretation which defines the semantics, meta-model description which describe the abstract syntax, run-time state specification which is the definition of the concrete syntax, and some run-time state specification examples.
The definition of the language occurs on different layers (Figure \ref{fig:asml}). On the top layer, we define a language for specify a type of state an application. Such a specification of a specific type of state resides on the middle layer. Concrete instances of this type, a specific run-time state of an application, is located on the bottom layer. All three layers are explained subsequently.
