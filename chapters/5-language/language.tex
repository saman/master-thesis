\chapter{Language for Run-time State Migration}
\label{ch:language}
Based on the requirements D1 to D3 (Chapter \ref{ch:requirements}) for defining a specification of a run-time state in a platform-independent manner, a DSL should exist to enable run-time states migration.
In this chapter, the DSL definition and interpretation, specification of run-time state, and terminology used are described. This includes the interpretation which defines the semantics, meta-model description which describe the abstract syntax, run-time state specification which is the definition of the concrete syntax, and some run-time state specification examples.
